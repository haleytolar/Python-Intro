# Exercise 1.1

This folder contains the files for **Exercise 1.1** as part of a Python course. The exercise demonstrates basic Python functionality, including accepting user input and performing simple arithmetic.

## Contents

- `add.py`: A Python script that prompts the user for two numbers, adds them, and displays the result.
- `hello.py`: A simple script that prints a greeting message.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing any dependencies for this exercise, in case additional packages are required.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- (Optional) A virtual environment tool like `virtualenv` or `virtualenvwrapper`.

### Virtual Environment Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended for isolating dependencies):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv cf-python-base
    source cf-python-base/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
    ```

2. Install dependencies (if any) from `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Scripts

To run each script, make sure you're in the `Exercise 1.1` directory, and your virtual environment is activated (if you're using one). Use the following commands:

### `add.py`

This script will prompt you to enter two numbers, add them, and display the result.

```bash
python add.py
 ```

### `hello.py`

This script prints a simple greeting message.

```bash
python hello.py
 ```
