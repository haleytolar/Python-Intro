Question 1:
What is the difference between frontend and backend web development?
Frontend web development involves everything a user sees and interacts with on a website, such as layouts, buttons, and visual effects. It’s built using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which create a smooth, engaging experience for users. In contrast, backend development focuses on what goes on behind the scenes—handling data, business logic, and the overall functionality. It often involves managing databases, handling user authentication, and ensuring security. Languages commonly used for backend tasks include Python, PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), and Ruby on Rails.

If I were hired for backend programming…
I would likely work on tasks that support data and application functionality, such as database management, setting up user authentication and authorization, securing sensitive data with encryption or hashing, and building APIs that connect different parts of the system. I might also work with ORM/ODMs to streamline database interactions.

Question 2:
Comparing JavaScript and Python:
Both JavaScript and Python are popular, high-level languages known for their flexibility and ease of use. However, while JavaScript is mainly known for its role in building interactive web elements and can also be used for backend development (with Node.js), Python is highly valued for its readability and simplicity. Python’s syntax is straightforward, making it easy to understand and work with, even on larger projects.

Why Python could be a better choice for the project:
Python’s readability would help ensure that all team members, especially in a growing project, could quickly understand the codebase, which helps minimize mistakes. Additionally, Python has extensive libraries and frameworks for various use cases, an integrated package manager, and a vast, active community providing reliable support and updates. These features make Python highly efficient for web development, data processing, and machine learning projects.

Question 3:
Three goals for learning Python:

1 Gain a deeper understanding of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): I want to improve my skills in writing organized, modular, and reusable code using OOP principles.
2 Explore task automation with Python: Learning to automate repetitive tasks would be useful in improving productivity and efficiency.
3 Expand knowledge in backend development: I aim to become skilled in backend frameworks and tools to build secure, efficient web applications using Python.
